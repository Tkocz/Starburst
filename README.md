# Starburst

Starburst is an action-packed 2.5D multiplayer (one to four players) game. It was developed as a school assignment over the course of four weeks, by five students. Everything is written from the ground up; physics, rendering, sound, particles are all developed as part of this project and no third party libraries were used (except XNA/MonoGame since it was a requirement for the assignment!).
